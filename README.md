Solving questions on geeksforgeeks and saving the solutions for solved questions. Not necessarily the questions on the above link, but different problems too.


Important things to remember:

Map - key, value pairs, with unique keys, sorted keys, Red-Black trees x (unordered_map, non sorted, hash-table)

MultiMap - key value pairs, with keys, not necessarily unique, sorted keys, Red-Black trees x (unordered_multimap, non sorted, hash-table)

deque - double ended queue (back, front, push_back, push_front, pop_back, pop_front)

1. Set,  Red-Black trees
(i) Stores the values in sorted order.
(ii) Stores only unique values.
(iii) Elements can only be inserted or deleted but cannot be modified.
(iv) We can erase more than 1 element by giving start iterator and end iterator position.

2. multiset, Red-Black trees
(i) Stores elements in sorted order.
(ii) It allows storage of multiple elements.
(iii) We can erase more than 1 element by giving start iterator and end iterator.

3. unordered_set (hash-table)
(i) Elements can be stored in any order. ( no sorted order )
(ii) Stores only unique values.
(iii) Hash-table used to store elements.
(iv) We can erase only the element for which iterator position is given.

4. unordered_multiset (hash-table)
(i) Elements can be stored in any order.
(ii) Duplicate elements can be stored.
(iii) Hash-table used to store elements.
(iv) We can erase only the element for which iterator position is given.
